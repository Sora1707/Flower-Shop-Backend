### Usage (development)

#### Download packages

Use command prompt to download all necessary packages

#### Start server

We can start the server with 3 modes `dev` for development, `prod` for production and `test` for test.

Use command prompt and choose the right mode to start the server.

```bash
npm run dev
npm run prod
npm run test
```

For our current purpose, we use `dev` mode
